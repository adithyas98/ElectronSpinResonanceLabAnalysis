# ElectronSpinResonanceLabAnalysis


In this Lab Notebook I will be analyzing the Electron Spin Resonance Data. Through this experiment we will try to detect and Characterize the spin of electrons in the molecule DDPH. This will be done through the Continuous Wave method since it is the simplest method used to detect the resonance of electrons. The steps taken in this Lab Notebook are in accordance with the steps for analysis detailed in the lab manual for this particular experiment as written by Professor Conover.
